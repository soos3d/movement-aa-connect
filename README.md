# Particle Connect, Account Abstraction SDK, Next.js, & ethers V6 on the Movement Chain

⚡️ Basic demo application using `@particle-network/connectkit` and `@particle-network/aa` to initiate social login and send transactions via an account abstraction smart account on the [Movement Chain](https://movementlabs.xyz/)

> Note that Account Abstraction is included wihint the new `connectkit` package. `@particle-network/aa` is required when using an EIP 1193 provider like ehter.js.
> This demo showcases both options.

This app allows you to log in using social logins and interact with various testnets by displaying account information and sending a gasless transfer transaction to an address you can input in the UI.

Built using `create @particle-network/connectkit`

```sh
npm init @particle-network/connectkit@latest
# or
pnpm create @particle-network/connectkit@latest
# or
yarn create @particle-network/connectkit
```

Follow the instructions:

> **Note:** This implementation demonstrates Passkey Authentication. You must use a Biconomy or Coinbase smart account. For a complete list of smart accounts, refer to the [AA SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/aa/sdks/desktop/web#initialization) page.

## 🔑 Particle Connect

**Particle Connect** enables a unified modal driving connection with social logins (through Particle Auth) and standard Web3 wallets, creating an equally accessible experience for Web3 natives and traditional consumers. Particle Connect is an all-in-one SDK capable of handling end-to-end onboarding and wallet connection.

This app enables you to log in using social logins or Web3 methods via Particle Connect and interact with the Ethereum Sepolia, Base Sepolia, and Avalanche Fuji testnets. You can view your account information and send transfer transactions to any address you input in the UI.

## 🪪 Account Abstraction SDK

Particle Network natively supports and facilitates the end-to-end utilization of ERC-4337 account abstraction. This is primarily done through the account abstraction SDK, which can construct, sponsor, and send UserOperations, deploy smart accounts, retrieve fee quotes, and perform other key functions.

> Every gasless transaction is automatically sponsored on testnet. On mainnet, you'll need to deposit USDT in the Paymaster.

## What is Movement

Movement Blockchain is a high-performance, community-driven network of Move-based blockchains developed by Movement Labs. Focusing on scalability, security, and user accessibility, Movement Blockchain combines the strengths of the Move programming language—originally developed by Facebook for safe and efficient asset management—and modular customization.

## 🛠️ Quickstart

### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Particle-Network/movement-aa-connect
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Or

```sh
npm install
```

### Set environment variables
This project requires several keys from Particle Network to be defined in `.env`. The following should be defined:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`, the ID of the corresponding application in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY`, the ID of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`, the client key of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).

### Start the project
```sh
npm run dev
```

Or

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Development

Particle Connect config is in `src/components/ConnectKit.tsx`. 

### Config social logins

List of available social logins:

```sh
{
  email: 'email',
  phone: 'phone',
  facebook: 'facebook',
  google: 'google',
  apple: 'apple',
  twitter: 'twitter',
  discord: 'discord',
  github: 'github',
  twitch: 'twitch',
  microsoft: 'microsoft',
  linkedin: 'linkedin',
  jwt: 'jwt'
}
```

### Smart Account (AA) Options

You can configure the smart account using the `aa` plugin located in `src/components/ConnectKit.tsx`. Below is an example configuration:

```tsx
plugins: [
  // Smart Account (AA) configuration
  aa({
    name: "SIMPLE",
    version: "2.0.0",
  }),
],
```

#### Sending AA Transactions

You can send gasless transactions using the native `smartAccount` instance provided by Particle Connect. 

This does not require the Particle AA ADK.

Here’s an example from the demo:

```tsx
import { useSmartAccount } from "@particle-network/connectkit";
const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();

/**
 * Sends a transaction using the native AA Particle provider with gasless mode.
 */
const executeTxNative = async () => {
  setIsSending(true);
  try {
    const tx = {
      to: recipientAddress,
      value: parseEther("0.01").toString(),
      data: "0x",
    };

    // Fetch fee quotes and use verifyingPaymasterGasless for a gasless transaction
    const feeQuotesResult = await smartAccount?.getFeeQuotes(tx);
    const { userOp, userOpHash } =
      feeQuotesResult?.verifyingPaymasterGasless || {};

    if (userOp && userOpHash) {
      const txHash =
        (await smartAccount?.sendUserOperation({
          userOp,
          userOpHash,
        })) || null;

      setTransactionHash(txHash);
      console.log("Transaction sent:", txHash);
    } else {
      console.error("User operation is undefined");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to send transaction:", error);
  } finally {
    setIsSending(false);
  }
};
```

For users using an EIP1193 provider such as `ethers.js`, you'll need to leverage the Particle AA SDK. Install it with the following command:

```sh
yarn add @particle-network/aa
```

Here’s how to use it with `ethers.js`:

```tsx
// Initialize custom provider with gasless transaction mode
const customProvider = smartAccount
  ? new ethers.BrowserProvider(
      new AAWrapProvider(
        smartAccount,
        SendTransactionMode.Gasless
      ) as Eip1193Provider,
      "any"
    )
  : null;

/**
 * Sends a transaction using the ethers.js library.
 * This transaction is gasless since the customProvider is initialized as gasless.
 */
const executeTxEthers = async () => {
  if (!customProvider) return;

  const signer = await customProvider.getSigner();
  setIsSending(true);
  try {
    const tx = {
      to: recipientAddress,
      value: parseEther("0.01").toString(),
    };

    const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(tx);
    const txReceipt = await txResponse.wait();

    setTransactionHash(txReceipt?.hash || null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to send transaction using ethers.js:", error);
  } finally {
    setIsSending(false);
  }
};
```
